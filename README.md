# 🔢 Array-Based Algorithms (Python & Java)

Welcome to **Array-Based Algorithms**, a collection of the most essential and frequently used algorithms implemented in **both Python and Java**.  
This repository is designed for **interview preparation, DSA practice, and competitive programming** learners who want clear, side-by-side implementations.

---

## 📌 Overview
Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science.  
Understanding their patterns & techniques helps in solving a wide variety of problems.  
This repo covers **8 must-know array algorithms**, each explained and implemented in **Java** and **Python** for easy comparison.

## 📂 Algorithms Covered

| #   | Algorithm Name              | Description                                                                 |
|-----|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01  | Kadane's Algorithm          | Finds the maximum subarray sum in O(n) time.                               |
| 02  | Prefix Sum                  | Efficient range sum queries in constant time after preprocessing.           |
| 03  | Sliding Window              | Optimizes subarray-based problems with a moving window approach.            |
| 04  | Two Pointers                | Solves problems by scanning from both ends efficiently.                     |
| 05  | Dutch National Flag         | Sorts an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s in linear time with constant space.        |
| 06  | Merge Intervals             | Combines overlapping intervals into a single one.                           |
| 07  | MO's Algorithm              | Efficient algorithm for answering offline range queries using sqrt-decomp.  |
| 08  | Boyer-Moore Majority Vote   | Finds majority element (> n/2 occurrences) in linear time and O(1) space.   |
